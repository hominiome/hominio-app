# Option 1: Auto-bump version on push to main (minor bump)
# Uncomment below if you want automatic minor bumps on every push to main

# branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
# 
# if [ "$branch" = "main" ]; then
#   echo "🔄 Auto-bumping version (minor) for main branch..."
#   bun run version:bump:minor
#   git add package.json src-tauri/Cargo.toml src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
#   git commit -m "chore: bump version [skip ci]" --no-verify || true
# fi

# Option 2: Use semantic-release instead (RECOMMENDED)
# Just use conventional commits (feat:, fix:) and run `bun run release`
# This is better because it bumps based on commit types, not every commit
